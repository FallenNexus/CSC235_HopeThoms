(now): This is the very first test of my ND journal. I will be using this for shorter ideas when I don't have my design notebook on me.
(now): This is my current progress on the screenplay for my book, Lethe's Embrace to test how much this thing can hold: Yeah that did not go so well but it was funny
(now): I need to come up with a pen name for publishing, my ideas this far would be a name from roughly 2000 or 2001. These are the ideas I have at the moment: Alexandria Thomas, Alex Thomas, Ann  [insert some last name here].
